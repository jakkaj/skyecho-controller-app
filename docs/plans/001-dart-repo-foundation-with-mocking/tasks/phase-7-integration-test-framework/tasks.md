**Total Tasks**: 11 (2 Setup, 6 Core including 1 SAFETY CRITICAL, 0 Test, 1 Doc, 2 Integration)

**Estimated Complexity**: LOW-MEDIUM (mostly refactoring existing tests + documentation)

---

## Alignment Brief

### Objective Recap

**Primary Goal**: Formalize integration test infrastructure that gracefully detects device availability and skips tests when the physical SkyEcho device is not accessible.

**Behavior Checklist** (from plan acceptance criteria):
- [ ] Integration test helper detects device availability with 5-second timeout
- [ ] Existing integration tests from Phases 4-5 refactored to use shared helpers (5 total tests: 2 in device_status + 3 in setup_config)
- [ ] Tests skip gracefully with clear message when device unavailable
- [ ] ~~README documents integration test setup~~ ‚Üí **DEFERRED to Phase 9** (decision from didyouknow session)
- [ ] justfile has test-integration recipe (already complete from Phase 1)
- [ ] All integration tests pass when device available

**Success Criteria**:
1. Shared `helpers.dart` provides reusable device detection
2. All integration tests use consistent device detection pattern
3. Clear, actionable skip messages guide users to connect to device
4. ~~README documents integration test workflow~~ ‚Üí **DEFERRED to Phase 9**
5. Zero test failures when device unavailable (graceful skips only)
6. All tests pass when device is available

---

### Non-Goals (Scope Boundaries)

‚ùå **NOT doing in this phase:**
- Performance optimization of integration tests (defer to Phase 10)
- Mocking integration tests (integration tests MUST use real device)
- CI/CD configuration for integration tests (out of scope per plan)
- Automated device provisioning or reset between tests (manual setup acceptable)
- Testing with multiple firmware versions (single version sufficient per plan)
- Advanced test orchestration (parallel test execution, test ordering)
- Integration test coverage metrics (unit test coverage targets only)
- Web-based integration tests (device URL requires CORS proxy, out of scope)
- **Creating new integration test cases** (existing tests from Phases 4-5 provide sufficient coverage - decision from didyouknow session)
- Refactoring unit tests (only integration tests in scope)
- **Testing ADS-B transmission (1090ES transmit)** - SAFETY CRITICAL: Integration tests MUST NOT enable ADS-B output as this would transmit false aircraft position data visible to other aircraft and ATC

---

### Critical Findings Affecting This Phase

**Relevant Critical Discoveries from Plan ¬ß 3:**

1. **üö® Critical Discovery 02: MockClient HTTP Response Handling**
   - **Constraint**: Integration tests MUST use real `http.Client`, not `MockClient`
   - **Tasks addressing**: T002 (canReachDevice uses real HTTP client), T015/T016 (validation with real device)
   - **Impact**: Ensures integration tests catch real device communication issues that mocks would hide

2. **üö® Critical Discovery 04: Cookie Jar Without Sessions Library**
   - **Constraint**: Integration tests rely on `SkyEchoClient`'s internal `_CookieJar` for session management
   - **Tasks addressing**: T008, T009, T010 (smoke tests use real client with cookie management)
   - **Impact**: Integration tests validate cookie persistence across multiple requests (e.g., POST ‚Üí GET verification)

**Note**: Most critical discoveries (01, 03, 05) relate to HTML parsing and are not applicable to Phase 7 integration test infrastructure.

---

### Invariants & Guardrails

**Performance Budget**:
- Device detection timeout: **5 seconds** (matches SkyEchoClient default, proven in Phases 4-5, tolerates network latency)
- Integration test suite total time: **No strict limit** (device I/O inherently slower than unit tests)
- Per-test timeout: **10-20 seconds** (allows for network latency + device processing)

**Memory Budget**:
- No in-memory caching of responses (each test makes fresh HTTP calls)
- Small test fixture sizes (JSON responses ~1-15KB)

**Security**:
- Device URL hardcoded to `http://192.168.4.1` (private network, no auth)
- No sensitive data in test outputs (device status is non-sensitive)
- Document security implications in README (anyone on WiFi network can control device)

**SAFETY CRITICAL - ADS-B Transmission**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Integration tests MUST NEVER enable 1090ES transmit (`es1090TransmitEnabled` field in SetupConfig)
- **Rationale**: Enabling ADS-B transmission would broadcast false aircraft position data on 1090MHz, visible to other aircraft TCAS systems and ATC radar, creating serious safety hazard
- **Enforcement**:
  - All `applySetup()` calls in integration tests MUST NOT set `es1090TransmitEnabled` field (omit it, defaults to false)
  - T006a adds explicit assertion in roundtrip test: `expect(result.verifiedConfig!.es1090TransmitEnabled, isFalse)`
  - Tests that modify other transmit-related settings (receiverMode, uatEnabled, es1090Enabled) MUST verify `es1090TransmitEnabled` remains false
  - Document WARNING in README integration test section (T012)
- **In-Flight Testing**: ADS-B transmission testing deferred to manual in-flight validation by pilot (out of scope for automated tests)

### Test Plan

**Testing Approach**: Lightweight (per spec) - Focus on manual verification and smoke tests, not exhaustive integration test coverage.

**Test Categories**:

1. **Smoke Tests** (device_smoke_test.dart):
   - `test_ping_smoke` - Verify ping() returns true with real device
   - `test_fetch_status_smoke` - Verify fetchStatus() returns non-null status
   - `test_fetch_setup_config_smoke` - Verify fetchSetupConfig() returns non-null config

2. **Existing Integration Tests** (refactored to use helpers):
   - device_status_integration_test.dart (2 tests from Phase 4)
   - setup_config_integration_test.dart (3 tests from Phase 5, 1 skipped)

3. **Manual Validation Tests**:
   - Run with device connected ‚Üí all tests pass
   - Run without device ‚Üí all tests skip with clear message
   - Verify timeout behavior (2s max for device detection)

**Test Fixtures**:
- No new fixtures needed (use real device responses)
- Existing JSON fixtures from Phases 4-5 used in unit tests, not integration tests

**Expected Outputs**:
- **Device available**: 5 integration tests pass, debug output shows real device data
- **Device unavailable**: 5 integration tests skipped, skip message shows WiFi setup instructions

**Test Doc Requirements**:
- All integration tests MUST include complete Test Doc blocks (5 fields)
- Test names follow Given-When-Then pattern
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure in test bodies

---

### Step-by-Step Implementation Outline

**Phase 1: Create Shared Helper Infrastructure** (T001-T004)
1. Review existing integration test patterns (T001)
2. Create `test/integration/helpers.dart` (T002)
   - `canReachDevice(String url)` - Attempts ping with 5s timeout, returns bool
   - `deviceSetupMessage()` - Returns formatted skip message string
   - `printDeviceInfo(dynamic)` - Prints status/config for debugging
3. Write dartdoc comments for all helper functions
4. Validate: Run `dart analyze` on helpers.dart

**Phase 2: Refactor Existing Integration Tests** (T005-T006a)
1. Update device_status_integration_test.dart (T005)
   - Import helpers
   - Replace inline ping() detection with canReachDevice()
   - Use deviceSetupMessage() for skip warning
   - Validate: Run test without device, verify skip
2. Update setup_config_integration_test.dart (T006)
   - Add setUpAll with canReachDevice()
   - Add device detection to all tests
   - Use deviceSetupMessage() for skip warning
   - Validate: Run test without device, verify skip
3. **SAFETY CRITICAL**: Add ADS-B transmission safety assertion (T006a)
   - In "applies setup configuration and verifies roundtrip" test (line 43)
   - **Known baseline state approach**: Test already fetches original config at start, establishing known state
   - After `result.verifiedConfig!.callsign` assertion (line 72), add:
     ```dart
     expect(result.verifiedConfig!.es1090TransmitEnabled, isFalse,
         reason: 'SAFETY: 1090ES transmit must remain disabled in integration tests');
     ```
   - This prevents accidental enabling of ADS-B broadcast during automated testing
   - Validates device did not silently enable transmit during config update
   - Note: This test serves as **early warning** - if config updates don't work, fail fast

**Phase 3: Validation** (T007-T011)
1. Verify justfile recipe (T007) - Already complete
2. Test without device (T008) - Manual verification
3. Test with device (T009) - Manual verification with physical device
4. Review Test Doc completeness (T010)
5. Document patterns in execution log (T011)

**Checkpoints**:
- After Phase 1: helpers.dart analyzed clean
- After Phase 2: Existing tests skip gracefully without device, safety assertion added
- After Phase 3: All acceptance criteria met (README deferred to Phase 9)

### Risks/Unknowns

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| **‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY CRITICAL: ADS-B transmission accidentally enabled** | **CRITICAL** | **LOW** | **T006a adds explicit assertion that enable1090ESTransmit remains false after all config updates; README WARNING; code review required** |
| **Device not always available during development** | LOW | HIGH | Graceful skip is core feature; tests MUST skip cleanly |
| **Network configuration varies (WiFi SSID changes)** | LOW | MEDIUM | Document WiFi setup clearly in README; use standard device URL |
| **Timeout too short (false negatives)** | LOW | LOW | Use 5-second timeout (matches SkyEchoClient default, proven in Phases 4-5); tolerates network latency |
| **Timeout too long (slow test feedback)** | LOW | LOW | 5-second timeout only affects device unavailable scenario (once per test run) |
| **Integration tests flaky due to device state** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Use defensive assertions (isNotNull vs exact values); document in Test Docs |
| **Destructive tests (factory reset) run accidentally** | HIGH | LOW | Use `skip: true` on destructive tests; document WARNING in Test Doc |
| **Multiple developers sharing same device** | LOW | LOW | Document sequential test execution; no parallel support needed |
| **README becomes stale as API evolves** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Phase 9 documentation update will refresh; keep examples minimal |

- [ ] Critical findings understood (Discovery 02, 04)

**GO/NO-GO Decision Points**:
1. **After T004 (helpers created)**: Do helper functions cover all needed patterns? ‚Üí GO if yes
2. **After T006 (refactor complete)**: Do existing tests skip gracefully? ‚Üí GO if yes
3. **After T010 (smoke tests created)**: Do smoke tests pass with device? ‚Üí GO if yes
4. **After T013 (README written)**: Is integration test workflow clear? ‚Üí GO if yes
5. **After T017 (validation complete)**: All acceptance criteria met? ‚Üí GO to Phase 8 if yes

**Explicit User Approval Required**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Before T016 (test with device)**: Confirm physical device available and accessible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Before marking phase complete**: Review execution log and README documentation

## Implementation Notes

**Key Patterns to Follow**:
1. **Device Detection**: Always use `canReachDevice()` in setUpAll, never inline
2. **Skip Messages**: Always use `deviceSetupMessage()` for consistency
3. **Test Doc Blocks**: All integration tests require complete 5-field Test Doc
4. **Timeout Annotations**: Use `timeout: Timeout(Duration(seconds: N))` for tests with device I/O
5. **Debug Output**: Use `printDeviceInfo()` helper for consistent formatting

**TAD Philosophy for Integration Tests**:
- Integration tests are **documentation** of real device behavior
- Test Docs explain WHY integration (not unit) test is needed
- Usage Notes document device requirements (WiFi network, URL)
- Worked Examples show real device responses

**Phase 7 Success Definition**:
- Zero test failures when device unavailable (graceful skips)
- All tests pass when device available
- ~~Clear, actionable documentation in README~~ ‚Üí **DEFERRED to Phase 9**
- Reusable helper infrastructure for future integration tests

---

**STOP**: Do **not** edit code. Wait for human **GO** signal.

**Next Step**: Run `/plan-6-implement-phase --phase "Phase 7: Integration Test Framework" --plan "/Users/jordanknight/github/skyecho-controller-app/docs/plans/001-dart-repo-foundation-with-mocking/dart-repo-foundation-with-mocking-plan.md"` after approval.

## Critical Insights Discussion

**Session**: 2025-10-18
**Context**: Phase 7 Integration Test Framework - Tasks & Alignment Brief
**Analyst**: AI Clarity Agent
**Reviewer**: Development Team
**Format**: Water Cooler Conversation (5 Critical Insights)

### Insight 1: Incomplete ADS-B Safety Coverage

**Did you know**: While we're protecting against accidental `es1090TransmitEnabled` activation, there are multiple other fields in SetupConfig that could enable ADS-B transmission, and we're not currently guarding against them.

**Implications**:
- T006a adds assertion for `es1090TransmitEnabled` only
- Device might have auto-enable logic based on other fields (receiverMode, es1090Enabled, UAT fields)
- Future developers could accidentally set transmit-enabling values in other fields
- Safety assertion gives false confidence about complete safety

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Comprehensive Transmit State Assertion - Check ALL transmit-related fields
- Option B: Read-Only Integration Tests - Remove config update tests entirely
- Option C: Explicit Transmit-Disabled Config Baseline - Verify baseline before/after updates
- Option D: Current Plan + Documentation Warning - Keep single-field assertion, document limitation

**AI Recommendation**: Option A (Comprehensive Transmit State Assertion)
- Reasoning: Matches CRITICAL severity; prevents silent failures; self-documenting

**Discussion Summary**:
User clarified that device has NO auto-enable transmit logic. Only `es1090TransmitEnabled` field controls transmission. Other fields (receiverMode, es1090Enabled) do not trigger auto-enable.

**Decision**: Keep current single-field assertion for `es1090TransmitEnabled`

**Action Items**: None - T006a as currently specified is adequate

**Affects**: No changes to tasks.md (confirmed current approach is correct)

### Insight 2: Device Detection Timeout Creates False Negatives

**Did you know**: A 2-second timeout might be too aggressive for real-world WiFi networks, and we could end up skipping tests even when the device IS actually available - just experiencing normal network latency.

**Implications**:
- Network latency >2s (but device functional) ‚Üí timeout ‚Üí tests skip
- Developers on slow WiFi get spurious skips
- "Works on my machine" syndrome (fast vs slow WiFi)
- False sense of security from skipped tests

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Increase Timeout to 5 Seconds - Matches SkyEchoClient default
- Option B: Retry Logic (2 attempts √ó 2 seconds) - Fast success, tolerates transients
- Option C: Progressive Timeout (2s ‚Üí 5s fallback) - Fast path + patient fallback
- Option D: Keep 2 Seconds + Verbose Logging - Make false negatives visible

**AI Recommendation**: Option A (Increase to 5 Seconds)
- Reasoning: Consistency with proven 5s default; simplicity; low cost (only at test startup)

**Discussion Summary**:
User agreed with Option A - aligning with proven 5-second timeout makes sense.

**Decision**: Increase `canReachDevice()` timeout to 5 seconds

**Action Items**:
- [x] Update T002 validation to specify 5s timeout (completed)
- [x] Update Invariants & Guardrails section to reflect 5s timeout (completed)
- [x] Update implementation outline Phase 1 to show 5s timeout (completed)
- [x] Update risks table timeout risks (completed)
- [x] Update manual testing checklist (completed)

**Affects**: T002, Invariants & Guardrails, Implementation Outline, Risks table, Manual Testing Checklist

### Insight 3: Smoke Tests Don't Actually Test Core Functionality

**Did you know**: Our planned "smoke tests" in `device_smoke_test.dart` are actually just duplicates of existing integration tests from Phases 4-5, and they don't add any new validation or smoke test value.

**Implications**:
- T007-T010 create 3 "new" smoke tests with zero additional coverage
- Test duplication makes maintenance harder
- Smoke tests don't validate actual workflow (just individual API calls)
- True smoke test should be end-to-end: Connect ‚Üí Read ‚Üí Write ‚Üí Verify

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Replace with True End-to-End Smoke Test - Single comprehensive workflow test
- Option B: Eliminate Smoke Test File Entirely - Rely on existing tests from Phases 4-5
- Option C: Keep Smoke Tests as Quick Subset - Tag-based separation (smoke vs comprehensive)
- Option D: Current Plan (Keep Duplicate Tests) - Accept duplication for "consolidated location"

**AI Recommendation**: Option B (Eliminate Smoke Test File)
- Reasoning: Already have coverage; avoid duplication; existing tests ARE smoke tests; simplicity

**Discussion Summary**:
User agreed with Option B - keeping it simple and avoiding duplication.

**Decision**: Eliminate smoke test file entirely (device_smoke_test.dart)

**Action Items**:
- [x] Remove tasks T007-T010 from task table (completed)
- [x] Renumber remaining tasks (completed)
- [x] Update task count: 11 tasks (was 14) (completed)
- [x] Update behavior checklist to reference existing 5 tests (completed)
- [x] Update Non-Goals section (completed)
- [x] Update implementation phases - remove Phase 3 smoke tests (completed)
- [x] Update checkpoints (completed)
- [x] Update directory layout (completed)
- [x] Update supporting files list (completed)

**Affects**: Tasks table, task count, acceptance criteria, implementation outline, success criteria, directory layout

### Insight 4: Missing Cleanup Strategy for Test Config Changes

**Did you know**: When the roundtrip test updates the device config, if the test fails or crashes mid-execution, the device is left in a modified state with no automatic cleanup.

**Implications**:
- Test updates callsign ‚Üí test crashes ‚Üí cleanup never runs ‚Üí device polluted
- After multiple failed runs: callsign = "N9954TTTTT" (keeps appending)
- Manual device reconfiguration required
- Tests no longer idempotent

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Dart setUp/tearDown with State Snapshot - Automatic cleanup via tearDown()
- Option B: Accept Dirty State + Document Manual Reset - Current approach + docs
- Option C: Defensive Test Design (Read-Only Baseline) - Don't test config updates
- Option D: Smart Cleanup (Best Effort Restore) - addTearDown() + documentation

**AI Recommendation**: Option D (Smart Cleanup with Documentation)
- Reasoning: Practical balance; acknowledges hard crashes need manual intervention; preserves coverage

**Discussion Summary**:
User pointed out excellent alternative: Get device in known state at START of test, not cleanup at end. Roundtrip test is early warning - if it fails, other tests won't work anyway.

**Decision**: Establish known baseline state at test start (setUp/setUpAll)

**Action Items**:
- [x] Add note to T006a about known baseline state approach (completed)
- [x] Document that roundtrip test serves as early warning (completed)

**Affects**: T006a validation criteria, Phase 2 implementation outline

### Insight 5: README Documentation Scope Mismatch

**Did you know**: We're planning to create a full project README in Phase 7, but the plan document says README documentation should happen in Phase 9: Documentation (Hybrid) - creating potential duplication and confusion.

**Implications**:
- Phase 7 creates README (T007-T009)
- Phase 9 will "update README.md with quick-start"
- Risk of conflicts if Phase 9 rewrites Phase 7 content
- Unclear ownership of README content
- Writing integration test docs twice (Phase 7 draft + Phase 9 final)

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Defer README to Phase 9 Entirely - Single source of truth, follows plan order
- Option B: Minimal README Stub in Phase 7 - Placeholder with "See docs/plans for now"
- Option C: Current Plan (Phase 7 Creates, Phase 9 Updates) - Incremental documentation
- Option D: README Owned by Phase 7, Phase 9 Adds docs/how/ - Expand Phase 7 scope

**AI Recommendation**: Option A (Defer README to Phase 9)
- Reasoning: Follows original plan; avoids duplication; better timing (all features implemented); developers can use CLAUDE.md + Test Docs until then

**Discussion Summary**:
User agreed with Option A - keeping documentation focused in Phase 9 where it belongs.

**Decision**: Defer README creation to Phase 9 entirely

**Action Items**:
- [x] Remove tasks T007-T009 (README creation) (completed)
- [x] Renumber remaining tasks (completed)
- [x] Update task count: 11 tasks (was 14) (completed)
- [x] Update behavior checklist - mark README as deferred to Phase 9 (completed)
- [x] Update success criteria - mark README as deferred (completed)
- [x] Remove Phase 3 Documentation from implementation outline (completed)
- [x] Renumber Phase 4 Validation ‚Üí Phase 3 Validation (completed)
- [x] Update checkpoints (completed)
- [x] Update supporting files (completed)
- [x] Update directory layout (completed)

**Affects**: Tasks table, task count, acceptance criteria, implementation outline, checkpoints, supporting files, directory layout
